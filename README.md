<h2> Description </h2>
A full-stack Chrome extension that seamlessly integrates RateMyProfessors.com ratings into McMaster Universityâ€™s course enrollment page, providing students with easy access for informed selections!
<br/><br/>
API: https://github.com/sabrahahmed/McMaster-RMP_API<br/>

<br/>
After logging in to the course enrollment page, the extension activates and promptly initiates the process of detecting any professor names on the page, subsequently retrieving their data from RateMyProfessors.com. The professors' ratings are displayed next to their names, color-coded based on the score. This allows students to make informed course and professor selections when creating their timetable!

</p>

Students can also hover over the ratings or professor names, triggering a popup to appear next to each professor, providing additional information about their ratings. This data encompasses their overall rating, difficulty level, the percentage of students who would consider taking their course(s) again, and the total number of ratings contributing to these scores. Students are also encouraged to assess the accuracy of these ratings by reading reviews, which they can access directly from the popup. Clicking on the reviews will redirect them to the selected professor's RateMyProfessors.com profile.

Upon logging in, users can easily customize their pacemaker settings across four pacing modes and visualize live heart electrogram data captured via PySerial (serial communication) and plotted using Python's Matplotlib library.
